# Software-Development-Lifecycle_COURSE

SNHU Travel is the project I had to work on its lifecycle, first we started with a meeting gathering requirements and what the business is aiming to get
out of the system we are going to develop. Taking notes in the meeting is an essential task as a System Analyst. Listening and clarifying their needs and 
guiding them what is or is not possible to be done is another thing a system analyst needs to consider. From the requirements gathered we can start by
identifying user stories. User stories help us priorities features needed in the system based on the verbal requirement the users provided. We can turn
these requirements into more technical requirements in user stories.

I approach software development as a puzzle to be solved. First we need to see the big picture, identify the scope (boundaries) and setting timelines. 
In software the puzzle is the whole system to be developed, and the pieces are what the users or stakeholders have as requirements. So the first step to
software development is Planning, where we assess feasibility and create a project plan. Then we start analyzing by gathering requirements, and create 
process diagrams and analyzing them into details. Once we have that done we start by designing, we need an infrastructure to work with and we need to get
more technical since we need to decide what languages to use, operating systems, databases and so on.
Once design is all set, implementation comes to place, we jump into coding, implementing and testing, reviewing and adjusting. Coding is the most technical 
part of the software lifecycle, we need to be fully engaged in the project and its design to be able to take advantages of the resources we have at hand 
fully. The software is coming into life here and it's a matter of time, dedication and consistency to have it in production.
Testing can be part of the implementation as it is depending on the code. 
When all every thing is tested and running good we can deploy, as this phase depends on the companies methodology, deployment can be continuous where we 
deploy what is done in each sprint or we can wait until the end and deploy it all together. However I would suggest having continuous integration as some 
features may behave differently on a cloud server or production than locally. Take picture links for example or dependencies, cross site restrictions or 
connections uris. 
Once deployed, the system should be maintained. Getting periodic feedback and logs is a good way to keep an eye on its behavior, scaling and updating
resources is a must. Once the system is spread scaling is a must, and updating it can result in loss of clients if badly updated. So I would suggest being
very attentive to details and backing up before hand of doing so.

Being a good team members, in my opinion is being able to accept critiques, open to new methods and ways to perform some actions, being too involved in the
project and have attention to detail. Always thinking in a way to maximize functionality with the resources at hand and being self organized will also help 
others and superiors to see new perspectives and opportunities. Once a memeber needs help, it's a good idea to help when time allows it, and it all comes 
back to how involved a member is in the project to have to initiative to put more effort to help others. If I am stuck, the first thing I would do is 
notify the lead, try re-organizing with some research if time allows, and ask for help right away if it's a critical matter. The last thing you need as a 
team member to have your colleagues hold for you to submit. But sometimes some challenges come with a small amount of time to be solved so it's always good
to ask for help from more experienced ones.

Thanks for reading ! and I hope you benefit from this project !
